# Kickstarter Campaign Analysis
Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns for proposed project funding, completed December 2021 for Louise
## Overview
* This project was completed for Louise to provide insights on prior Kickstarter campaigns in order to have the best chance of succcess of creating her own campaign to fund her play _Fever_, which has an estimated budget over $10,000.
* This dataset covered 4,115 Kickstarter campaigns, featuring a wide range of subjects, time, periods, locations, and funding requets, including:
  * 21 different countries
  * 9 unique sectors (i.e. theater) with an additional 41 subcategories (i.e. plays)
  * Campaign dates ranging from 2009-2017
  * Funding goals ranging from $1 to $100M, while actual pledges ranged from $0 to $2.3M
  * 53% of campaigns were successful, 37% failed, 8% were canceled, and 1% are still live

 ## Findings
 * Within the US, theater is the most common campaign subject on Kickstarter, ahead of music, film & video, and technology.
   * With a 58% success rate, theater is the third most likely category to have a successful campaign, behind music (77%) and film & video (62%).

 * Of the 912 US theater campaigns, 314 or 34% were specifically for plays.
   * Plays tend to be even more successful than the average for theater - 76% were successful.
 * When examining all theater campaigns (agnostic of country), the most successful campaigns were launched in May, with a decline in success rate through the rest of the year.

 * For play campaigns that were successfully funded, the mean goal was $5,049 and mean pledged was $5,602, but that is skewed by outliers that had goals/funding up to $100,000.
   * The median goal for a successful play was $3,000. The median pledged was $3,168.
   * 75% of goals were $5,000 or less and only 25% of plays raised pledges above $5,699.
   * Failed Kickstarter campaigns for plays tended to have higher goals (mean of $10,554 and median of $5,000), but raised significantly less than successfully funded plays.

## Recommendations
To set-up Louise for the best chance of a success Kickstarter campaign, I recommend she adhere to the following guidelines:
  1. **Timing** - If possible, launch the campaign in May.
  2. **Goal** - Don't ask for too much money. The initial budget of $10,000 is likely too high because it would be an outlier based on goals and funding in the past.
